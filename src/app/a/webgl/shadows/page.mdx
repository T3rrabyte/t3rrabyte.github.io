You may need to read the articles about [cubemaps](/a/webgl/cubemaps) and [framebuffers](/a/webgl/framebuffers) before this one.

## Shadow Maps

The most common way to render shadows is with _shadow maps_, which are textures that contain depth data from the point of view of a light source. A shadow map can be created by rendering a scene to a framebuffer with a depth attachment from the point of view of the light source. The fragment's depth is stored in the first (`r`) channel of the depth texture.

Any surface that falls within the frustum of the projection but has a lower depth value than the shadow map at that position is in shadow.

```glsl
#version 300 es

precision mediump float;

in vec2 v_texcoord;
in vec4 v_projTexcoord;

uniform vec4 u_color;
uniform sampler2D u_texture;
uniform sampler2D u_projTexture;

out vec4 outColor;

void main() {
	vec3 projTexcoord = v_projTexcoord.xyz / v_projTexcoord.w;
	float depth = projTexcoord.z;

	bool inShadow = projTexcoord.x >= 0.0
		&& projTexcoord.x <= 1.0
		&& projTexcoord.y >= 0.0
		&& projTexcoord.y <= 1.0;

	float projDepth = texture(u_projTexture, projTexcoord.xy).r;
	float shadowLight = inShadow && projDepth <= depth ? 0.0 : 1.0;

	outColor = texture(u_texture, v_texcoord) * u_color;
	outColor.rgb *= shadowLight;
}
```

## Shadow Acne

The strange patterns in the example above are called _shadow acne_ and are a result of the limited resolution of the shadow map causing surfaces to shade themselves. The visual effect of shadow acne can be mitigated by adding a bias to the calculated depth of each fragment.

```glsl
float depth = projTexcoord.z + u_bias;
```

The bias required to remove shadow acne from a surface depends on the angle from the light source to that surface, so varying the bias value based on that angle can improve the appearance of the scene.

```glsl
float bias =
	max(u_biasFactor * (1.0 - dot(v_normal, u_lightDir)), u_biasMinimum);
```

Adding a bias can lead to an effect called _peter panning_ in which shadows appear to be slightly disjointed from their caster. The visual effect of peter panning can be mitigated by culling front faces when rendering the shadow map.
