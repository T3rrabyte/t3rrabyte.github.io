# Esoteric JavaScript

It is possible to write any JavaScript program with just six unique characters. Those characters are both square brackets, both parenthesis, the plus symbol, and the exclamation point (`[]()+!`). This concept is known as "[JSFuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSFuck)," named for a well-known esoteric programming language called "[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)."

One of the most unique features of JavaScript is its type system. JavaScript is not strictly-typed like most other languages (such as C and Java). Instead, variables are declared with either `let` or `const`, and can hold any data type. The feature that makes JSFuck possible is implicit type coercion: the system by which JavaScript converts variables to other types as necessary.

```js
("b" + "a" + +"a" + "a").toLowerCase(); // "banana"
```

In the example above, JavaScript tries to convert the second `"a"` into a number because of the extra `+` before it. Since `"a"` isn't a number, it gets converted to `NaN`. `NaN` then gets converted to a string when it is concatenated with the rest of the strings, making `"baNaNa"`. The call to `toLowerCase` makes the final string look like a normal word. This example uses implicit type coercion twice: once to convert `"a"` to a number, and once to convert `NaN` to a string.

There are too many type coercion rules to list, but some important ones are as follows:

- A number, when added to a string, becomes a string: `"a" + 0 == "a0"`.
- A boolean, when added to a number, becomes a number: `true + 0 == 1`. `false` becomes `0` and `true` becomes `1`.
- `+` and `-` can be used as unary operators to convert anything into a number. `+[] == 0`, `+true == 1`, and `+"a" == NaN` are all examples of this.
- `!` can be used as a unary operator to convert anything into a boolean. Falsy values (those that evaluate to `false`, such as `0`, `""`, and `false`) become `true`, and truthy values (those that evaluate to `true`, such as `1`, `"a"`, `[]`, `{}`, and `true`) become `false`.
- Adding an array to anything converts it into a string: `[] + [] == ""`.

## JavaScript With Thirteen Characters

Before I get into true JSFuck (which uses only six characters), I will cover the version covered in [this](https://youtu.be/sRWE5tnaxlI) video (which uses thirteen characters: `({[/>+!-=\]})`).

The basic elements that we can use to create everything else are empty objects (`{}`) and empty arrays (`[]`). Everything else is created by using operators to coerce and combine those values into others.

```js
const _object = "{}";
const _array = "[]";
```

The most basic values to start by making are the booleans: `true` and `false`. `false` can be created by negating any truthy value, such as an empty array. `true` can be created by negating `false`.

```js
const _false = `!${_array}`;
const _true = `!${_false}`;
```

Zero can be obtained easily by casting an empty array to a number. One can be obtained by casting `true` to a number.

```js
const _0 = `+${_array}`;
const _1 = `+${_true}`;
```

Note that another common way of making true is by negating zero (`!+[]`).

Every other number can be created by adding ones.

```js
// Only non-negative numbers are needed.
const _number = (n) => (n == 0 ? _0 : n == 1 ? _1 : `${_1}${_number(n - 1)}`);
```

Note that the original video created the above function by combining ones with `" + "`. This includes spaces, which are not part of the allowed thirteen characters. The spaces cannot be removed because then the leading pluses in the one strings would combine with the combining pluses to make increment operators (`++`). This issue can be resolved in various ways.

- Add true strings instead of one strings (`!![]+!![] == 2`; doesn't work to make `1`).
- Combine one strings without pluses (`+!![]+!![] == 2`; wastes one character unless making `1`; shown above).
- A combination of the above, returning the one string for `1` and combining true strings otherwise.

Additionally, numbers with more than one digit can be created by utilizing the way that arrays are converted to strings. For example, `[1] + [2] == "12"`, which can be cast back into a number by wrapping the entire line in parenthesis with a plus prefix (`+([1] + [2]) == 12`).

The video proceeds from this point by attempting to obtain the following characters: `"f"`, `"r"`, `"o"`, `"m"`, `"C"`, `"h"`, `"a"`, `"d"`, `"e"`, `"t"`, `"S"`, `"i"`, `"n"`, `"g"`, `"c"`, `"s"`, `"u"`, `"p"`, `" "`, and `"\"`.

`"a"` can be obtained from `"NaN"` at index `1`. `"NaN"` can be obtained by adding an array to `NaN`. `NaN` can be obtained by converting an object to a number.

```js
const _NaN = `+${_object}`;
const _NaN_string = `${_NaN}+${_array}`;
const _a = `(${_NaN_string})[${_1}]`;
```

When an object is converted to a string, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. This string yields the characters `"o"`, `"e"`, `"c"`, `"t"`, and `" "` from the list above.

```js
const _object_string = `(${_object}+${_array})`;
const _o = `${_object_string}[${_1}]`;
const _e = `${_object_string}[${_number(4)}]`;
const _c = `${_object_string}[${_number(5)}]`;
const _t = `${_object_string}[${_number(6)}]`;
const _space = `${_object_string}[${_number(7)}]`;
```

The characters `"f"` and `"s"` can be extracted from `"false"`, and `"r"` and `"u"` can be extracted from `"true"`.

```js
const _false_string = `(${_false}+${_array})`;
const _f = `${_false_string}[${_0}]`;
const _s = `${_false_string}[${_number(3)}]`;

const _true_string = `(${_true}+${_array})`;
const _r = `${_true_string}[${_1}]`;
const _u = `${_true_string}[${_number(2)}]`;
```

The characters `"n"` and `"i"` can be obtained from `"Infinity"`, which is the string form of `Infinity`, which can be obtained by dividing any non-zero number (one, in our case) by zero.

```js
const _Infinity = `${_1}/${_0}`;
const _Infinity_string = `(${_Infinity}+${_array})`;
const _n = `${_Infinity_string}[${_1}]`;
const _i = `${_Infinity_string}[${_number(3)}]`;
```

In JavaScript, everything is an object. Properties of objects can be accessed using either dot notation (`foo.bar`) or bracket notation (`foo["bar"]`). We now have the letters necessary to build the string `"constructor"`, which means that we can use bracket notation to access the constructor of any object. Converting the constructor of a string yields either `"function String() { [native code] }"` or `"function String() {\n[native code]\n}"` (depending on the interpreter), which yields `"i"`, `"n"`, `"S"`, `"g"`, and `"d"` from our list of characters.

```js
const _constructor_string = `\
${_c}+${_o}+${_n}+${_s}+${_t}+${_r}+${_u}+${_c}+${_t}+${_o}+${_r}`;

const _empty_string = `(${_array}+${_array})`;

const _string_constructor = `${_empty_string}[${_constructor_string}]`;

const _string_constructor_string = `(${_string_constructor}+${_array})`;

const _i = `${_string_constructor_string}[${_number(5)}]`;
const _n = `${_string_constructor_string}[${_number(7)}]`;
const _S = `${_string_constructor_string}[${_number(9)}]`;
const _g = `${_string_constructor_string}[${_number(14)}]`;
const _d = `${_string_constructor_string}[${_number(30)}]`;
```

The regular expression constructor yields `"p"`.

```js
const _regex = `/-/`; // Minimal regular expression.

const _regex_constructor = `${_regex}[${_constructor_string}]`;

const _regex_constructor_string = `(${_regex_constructor}+${_array})`;

const _p = `${_regex_constructor_string}[${_number(14)}]`;
```

We can also convert a regular expression that contains a backslash directly to a string to obtain `"\"`.

```js
const _backslash_regex = "/\\\\/";

const _backslash_regex_string = `(${_backslash_regex}+${_array})`;

const _backslash = `${_backslash_regex_string}[${_1}]`;
```

Every lowercase letter can be obtained by converting a number to a string using a sufficiently high base. We will use the `Number.toString` method to obtain our last two lowercase letters, `"h"` and `"m"`.

```js
const _toString_string = `${_t}+${_o}+${_S}+${_t}+${_r}+${_i}+${_n}+${_g}`;

const _h = `(${_number(17)})[${_toString_string}](${_number(18)})`;

const _m = `(${_number(22)})[${_toString_string}](${_number(23)})`;
```

Finally, the last character from the list, `"C"`, can be obtained by executing the function constructor. The function constructor is very similar to the infamous `eval` function in that it takes a string representing JavaScript code and executes it. A basic function can be created using the arrow notation. The function's constructor can be obtained like any other object's. Executing the function constructor with `"return escape"` as its parameter will cause it to return a function that returns the built-in `escape` function, which replaces a character with its escape sequence. Finally, a backslash can be passed to `escape` to create `"%5C"`, which contains `"C"`.

```js
const _function = "()=>{}";

const _function_constructor = `(${_function})[${_constructor_string}]`;

const _return_escape_string =
	`${_r}+${_e}+${_t}+${_u}+${_r}+${_n}+${_space}+${_e}+${_s}+${_c}+${_a}` +
	`+${_p}+${_e}`;

const _escape = `${_function_constructor}(${_return_escape_string})()`;

const _percent5C = `${_escape}(${_backslash})`;

const _C = `${_percent5C}[${_number(2)}]`;
```

With this, we now have the ability to construct the string `"toCharCode"`, which will allow us to convert any character into our allowed symbols.

```js
const _fromCharCode_string =
	`${_f}+${_r}+${_o}+${_m}+${_C}+${_h}+${_a}+${_r}+${_C}+${_o}+${_d}` +
	`+${_e}`;

const _string = (s) =>
	s
		.split("")
		.map((c) => {
			switch (c) {
				case "f":
					return _f;
				case "r":
					return _r;
				case "o":
					return _o;
				case "m":
					return _m;
				case "C":
					return _C;
				case "h":
					return _h;
				case "a":
					return _a;
				case "d":
					return _d;
				case "e":
					return _e;
				case "t":
					return _t;
				case "S":
					return _S;
				case "i":
					return _i;
				case "n":
					return _n;
				case "g":
					return _g;
				case " ":
					return _space;
				case "\\":
					return _backslash;
				default:
					return (
						`${_string_constructor}` +
						`[${_fromCharCode_string}]` +
						`(${_number(c.charCodeAt(0))})`
					);
			}
		})
		.join("+");
```

The final step is to take the string of code that we produce and execute it. As mentioned previously, the function constructor allows us to execute a string of JavaScript code.

```js
const compile = (code) => `${_function_constructor}(${_string(code)})()`;
```

## JavaScript With Six Characters

JSFuck uses only six characters (`[]()+!`), losing `{}>-=\` from the thirteen used above (`({[/>+!-=\]})`). Notably, this means that the only basic value that can be used to make other things is an empty array, since we no longer have access to curly braces to make objects with. We also can't use regular expressions or arrow functions.

`undefined` can be obtained by accessing the empty array property of an empty array.

```js
const _undefined = "[][[]]";
```

Between `"true"`, `"false"`, and `"undefined"`, it is possible to obtain the characters necessary to create the strings `"at"` and `"entries"`, both of which are names of methods on arrays. `"at"` is important because using it is the shortest way to create a function string. `"entries"` is important because executing it gives an array iterator, which becomes `"[object Array Iterator]"` when converted to a string. Those strings yield the characters necessary to form the string `"constructor"`. Just like before, this string can be used to obtain the function, string, number, and array constructors. The `name` property of the string constructor can be concatenated with `"to"` to make `"toString"`, which again grants access to all lowercase letters.

With that, it is possible to create the following string: `"try{String().normalize(false)}catch(f){return f}"`. This string can be executed using the function constructor, returning a `RangeError`. With the characters from converting that value to a string, it is possible to execute `"return RegExp"` to obtain a `RegExp`. Executing `RegExp` without any parameters returns a forward slash. Executing `RegExp` with just a forward slash returns a backslash. `[]+[[]].concat([[]])` returns a comma. `Function(try{Function([]+[[]].concat([[]]))}catch(f){return f})()` returns `"SyntaxError: Unexpected ','"`. With those characters, it is possible to obtain any unicode character by executing `Function("return '\uXXXX'")`, where `XXXX` is the character code **in hexadecimal**.

Since `NaN` cannot be created using an object anymore, it can instead be created like `+[false]`.
